 1: Coronaviruses are a type of virus. There are many different kinds, and s
    ome cause disease. A coronavirus identified in 2019, SARS-CoV-2, has cau
    sed a pandemic of respiratory illness, called COVID-19.
 3: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW
 4: COVID-19
 5: COVID-19 is the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that emerg
    ed in December 2019.
 6: COVID-19 can be severe, and has caused millions of deaths around the wor
    ld as well as lasting health problems in some who have survived the illn
    ess.
 7: The coronavirus can be spread from person to person. It is diagnosed wit
    h a laboratory test.
 8: COVID-19 vaccines have been authorized for emergency use by the U.S. Foo
    d and Drug Administration, and vaccination programs are in progress acro
    ss the U.S. and in many parts of the world.
 9: Prevention involves physical distancing, mask-wearing, hand hygiene and 
    staying away from others if you feel sick.
10: Lauren Sauer, M.S., director of operations for the Johns Hopkins Office 
    of Critical Event Preparedness and Response and director of research wit
    h the Johns Hopkins Biocontainment Unit, shares information about COVID-
    19 and what you need to know.
12: How does the coronavirus spread?
13: As of now, researchers know that the coronavirus is spread through dropl
    ets and virus particles released into the air when an infected person br
    eathes, talks, laughs, sings, coughs or sneezes. Larger droplets may fal
    l to the ground in a few seconds, but tiny infectious particles can ling
    er in the air and accumulate in indoor places, especially where many peo
    ple are gathered and there is poor ventilation. This is why mask-wearing
    , hand hygiene and physical distancing are essential to preventing COVID
    -19.
15: How did the coronavirus start?
16: The first case of COVID-19 was reported Dec. 1, 2019, and the cause was 
    a then-new coronavirus later named SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 may have origi
    nated in an animal and changed (mutated) so it could cause illness in hu
    mans. In the past, several infectious disease outbreaks have been traced
     to viruses originating in birds, pigs, bats and other animals that muta
    ted to become dangerous to humans. Research continues, and more study ma
    y reveal how and why the coronavirus evolved to cause pandemic disease.
18: What is the incubation period for COVID-19?
19: Symptoms show up in people within two to 14 days of exposure to the viru
    s. A person infected with the coronavirus is contagious to others for up
     to two days before symptoms appear, and they remain contagious to other
    s for 10 to 20 days, depending upon their immune system and the severity
     of their illness.
